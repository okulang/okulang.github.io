            The common wisdom is that computer languages are not like human lanuages. Period.
Well, although the computer science master's thesis was ostensibly on "first-class control", what it really did was indulge my love of constructing languages, and it even cited a linguistics paper.
Since I've had deep experience in the construction of both human and computer languages, I may as well look at the difference.
It turns out there are more connections than I had at first thought.
