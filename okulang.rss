        <p>
I was just looking at DJP's haiku contest this year, since I just now found his blog.
Yes, yes, you're allowed to yell at me about not knowing anything about the conlang community (conmunity?)...
if you can find the comment box.
Nya-nya!
</p>

Anyway, if I'm to be perfectly honest, I wasn't very happy when I first heard Valyrian.
My first impression was that it was, um, chewing the scenery maybe?; it's hard to describe.
In any case, I've now seen it written, and I like it more that way.
In fact, I may just look up some materials and get some familiarity.
Oddly, even though I do really like the sound of Dothraki or Na'vi, I haven't bothered to introduce myself to them really.
How could Valyrian jump to the top spot on my reading list with such a poor first impression, I hear you not asking?
</p>

<p>
Well, as long-time followers won't know, I've recently (this summer) become a bit enamored of Old Norse and Ukrainian.
I'd done some initial work for a language based on those sounds under the names Myrkolð /myrkɒlθ/ and Anj /ɑnʲ/, but just didn't enjoy them; something was missing.
I have a sneaking suspicion that Valyrian is the secret ingredient.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to ressurrecting the language, but first things first: I have to get Iskki Leke'sou [isːki lɛgɛʔsəʊ̜] working before I pollute my brain with any other cool ideas.
