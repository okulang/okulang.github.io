    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
I'm Eric Demko, a.k.a. Okuno Zankoku, but I've kinda given up on internet pseudonyms.
I started conlanging in 2004, when my parents got me a book on Tolkien's languages.
Ever since then, I've conlanged sporadically, growing each time.
</p>

<p>
I'm primarily interested in naturalistic a prioiri artistic constructed languages.
That is, I like to make languages from scratch, as an artistic endeavour, and I like to make them seem realistic (natural).
My special interests are in phonology, and to a lesser extent, typology and morphosyntactic alignment.
</p>

<p>
I'm not very good at learning languages even though I'm very quick study with the grammar, because I don't like to spend the time to learn the vocabulary.
Nevertheless, I've had instruction in a variety of languages: German, Latin, Japanese, and Ukranian.
If I could pick a handful of languages to know, they might be (in no particular) Tzotzil, Evenki, Old Norse, Dalmatian, and Farsi.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I have little ideas for languages.
Rather than let those ideas slip into obscurity, I'd prefer to have them documented.
So far, I've really only published Tayéin (okay and a couple languages from my dark ages of conlanging I'd rather not look at), but I've got bits, peices, and sketches: Likăku'a, Mígǎciw, Fäesek, and Eruxjunsjukiettaneraro, and those are just the ones that have names.
This site will be a place where I can post big works, but I hope I'll also come here more often to post the smaller things.
